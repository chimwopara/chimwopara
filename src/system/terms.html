                    <p>A portion of the proceeds from Wopara Standard and Wopara Pro memberships on wopara.com is directed toward <strong>Orphans in Tech 2040</strong>, a philanthropic initiative founded by Chim Wopara.</p>
                    <p>The mission of Orphans in Tech 2040 is to equip orphanages in rural communities worldwide with the latest digital skills — specifically web development — empowering orphans to build real websites for real clients on chimwopara.com. Orphans who participate in the programme retain <strong>100% of the revenue</strong> they earn from websites they create using our brand and client connections. That revenue is used to fund their livelihoods and further humanitarian efforts.</p>
                    <p>By subscribing to any paid plan, you are directly contributing to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Youth Empowerment:</strong> Teaching orphans marketable digital skills that enable them to earn a sustainable income.</li>
                        <li><strong>Philanthropy:</strong> Funding education, housing, and living expenses for orphans in rural areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Impact:</strong> Building a foundation-funded cycle where our members power opportunities for those who need them most.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Our goal:</strong> By 2040, empower 40,000 orphans in tech who have collectively raised $40 million in revenue — a self-sustaining foundation fuelled entirely by the Wopara community.</p>
